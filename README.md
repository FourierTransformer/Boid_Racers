[This website](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_Vanquish "Apparently this is a thing")
claims that an Aston Martin Vanquish is 4.665 meters by 1.923 meters. Our pixelated version of the same vehicle is 62 by 33 pixels. The length of the car suggests 13.3 pixels per meter, while the width suggests 17.16. We decided to average them to 15 pixels per meter.
